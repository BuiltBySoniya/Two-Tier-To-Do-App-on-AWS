# Two-Tier-To-Do-App-on-AWS
Deployed a scalable To-Do web app using a two-tier architecture: EC2 for the Node.js app, Amazon RDS (MySQL) for data, and an Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution. Built inside a secure VPC with public/private subnets, security groups, and least-privilege IAM.
